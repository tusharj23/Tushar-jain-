The Python bootcamp was very  knowledgeablle . 
We had a very dedicated team of seniors who taught us enthusiastically throughout the timeline of the project .
Everything was fine . But the pace of last class was a litte bit high .
I acknowledge Sagar, Bhavay and Ansh who dedicatedly taught us throughout the camp and are encouraging to all the doubts we ask  them .
Thank you
